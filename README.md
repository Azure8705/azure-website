Hi, this is a quick and simple Nodejs package that I'm starting with on Cloud9 IDE and am using to get a start on my portfolio. 

as of 8/8/15

Included in package:

- Node v0.12.7
- Bootsrap v2.3.1
- NPM v2.13.4
- Yeoman
- Grunt
 


## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.
